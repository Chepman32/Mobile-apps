# Survival Skills & Emergency Preparedness Game

This directory contains a minimal React Native project scaffolded with Expo. It can be extended to build the educational survival simulation described in the project brief.

## How to Run

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
cd SurvivalGameApp
yarn install
expo start
```

Currently the app includes placeholder screens only.

Look forward to more survival scenarios and family planning tools.
