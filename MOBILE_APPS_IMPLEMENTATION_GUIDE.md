## 🎯 Common Features Implementation

### 1. Offline Storage Strategy
```typescript
// For simple data: MMKV
import { MMKV } from 'react-native-mmkv';
const storage = new MMKV();

// For complex data: SQLite
import SQLite from 'react-native-sqlite-storage';
const db = SQLite.openDatabase({name: 'app.db'});
```

### 2. Search & Filter Pattern
```typescript
const useSearch = <T>(items: T[], searchFields: (keyof T)[]) => {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
  const [filters, setFilters] = useState<any>({});
  
  const filteredItems = useMemo(() => {
    return items.filter(item => {
      // Search logic
      const matchesQuery = searchFields.some(field => 
        String(item[field]).toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase())
      );
      
      // Filter logic
      const matchesFilters = Object.entries(filters).every(([key, value]) => 
        !value || item[key as keyof T] === value
      );
      
      return matchesQuery && matchesFilters;
    });
  }, [items, query, filters]);
  
  return { filteredItems, query, setQuery, filters, setFilters };
};
```

### 3. IAP Integration Pattern
```typescript
interface IAPFeature {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  price: string;
}

const usePremiumFeatures = () => {
  const [purchasedFeatures, setPurchasedFeatures] = useState<string[]>([]);
  
  const isPremiumFeature = (featureId: string) => 
    purchasedFeatures.includes(featureId);
    
  const purchaseFeature = async (featureId: string) => {
    // IAP logic here
  };
  
  return { isPremiumFeature, purchaseFeature };
};
```
