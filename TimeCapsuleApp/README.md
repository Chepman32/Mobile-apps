# Personal Time Capsule & Memory Maker

This folder contains a simple Expo React Native project to serve as the basis for the time capsule application. The implementation is minimal and can be expanded according to the project requirements.

## Usage

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
cd TimeCapsuleApp
yarn install
expo start
```

The current code provides placeholders for creating and viewing time capsules. More features will be implemented in the future.
