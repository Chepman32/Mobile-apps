# Creative Story Builder & Sharing Platform

This folder contains a basic React Native project set up with Expo. It serves as a starting point for building the multimedia story creation app described in the project specifications.

## Running the App

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
cd StoryBuilderApp
yarn install
expo start
```

The current implementation includes only placeholder screens and minimal navigation.

Future updates will bring collaborative creation and premium assets.
